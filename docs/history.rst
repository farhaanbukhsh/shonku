History of the project
=======================

More than a year back I was introduced to `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_, a static
blog/site generator written in Python. It completely changed my view about blogs.
Blogging suddenly become simple again and I started spending more time in writing than
thinking about formatting etc.

But I was having problem in maintaining my theme and dependencies between upgrades
also increased (which is a good thing in one way as the upstream is adding a
lot of features in Nikola).

I started shonku from there with a hope to keep it as simplified Nikola written
in `golang <http://golang.org>`_. It works very fast too.
